**Photoreal LoRA Generation Cheat Sheet**

---

**✅ What You Already Have:**

* Flux Dev fp8 base model (confirmed working)
* Custom LoRA trained on your face (solid results)
* ComfyUI setup (verified)
* Good lighting and angles in your training set
* No major artifacting in LoRA samples

---

** It All Comes Down To:**

### 1. Prompting Skill — This Is Everything

* Focus on **minimalist, photoreal prompts**
* Use **realistic camera + lens terms**, e.g.:

  * `DSLR photo`, `85mm lens`, `f/1.8`, `Fujifilm color`
* Add **lighting descriptors**:

  * `sunset glow`, `soft window light`, `overcast daylight`, `natural light`
* Avoid oversaturating or overloading with detail
* Example:

  ```
  <lora_name>, natural skin, soft side light, close-up portrait, 85mm lens, f/1.8, Fujifilm color, realistic photo
  ```

### 2. LoRA Strength / CFG Settings

* LoRA weight: `0.6 – 0.8`
* CFG scale: `6.5 – 8.5`
* Sampler: `DPM++ 2M SDE Karras`
* Steps: `30 – 40`

### 3. Post-Processing (Optional)

* `FaceDetailer` pass to enhance eyes/lips subtly
* Use `Magnific` AI for upscale (for dating apps / print)

---

### 4. Fallback Plan: Face Swaps

* If gens aren't context-photoreal, **use LoRA for identity only**
* Swap identity onto:

  * Stock base bodies (Unsplash, studio models, etc.)
  * Your own photos or influencer-style pics

**TL;DR:**
You've already nailed the hard stuff. Now it's:

> **Prompt engineering + lighting awareness = realism**
